# Chada Tech Dual Clocks Project

## Overview
This project was developed as part of a coding challenge for a Junior Developer position at Chada Tech. It features an object-oriented C++ application that simultaneously displays a 12-hour and a 24-hour clock interface. The application adheres to ISO 8601 standards, catering to both domestic and international clients.

## Functional Requirements
The clocks allow for user interaction, where the user can input the time, and both 12-hour and 24-hour formats are updated and displayed accordingly. The program is designed with the following functional requirements in mind:

- Simultaneous display of both 12 and 24-hour formats.
- User ability to input time.
- Error checking and input validation to ensure time data is accurate.
- Easy-to-read and understand display format.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you will need a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. Clone the repository to your local machine, compile the source files, and run the executable.

### Prerequisites
- A modern C++ compiler
- Basic understanding of terminal or command-line interfaces

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Chada-Tech-Dual-Clocks.git

g++ -o DualClocks main.cpp Clock.cpp -std=c++11

./DualClocks
Usage
Upon launching the application, follow the on-screen prompts to input the time. The program will then display the time in both 12-hour and 24-hour formats.

Reflection
Summarize the project: This project simulates dual-format clocks to assist in meeting the international time display standards for Chada Tech.
Strengths: The code is well-documented, modular, and utilizes OOP principles for clarity and reusability.
Areas for enhancement: [No potential enhancements to be done]
Challenges: [N/A]
Transferable Skills: Object-oriented design, error checking, user input validation, and modular programming.
